# WSNets

**WSNets is beta version fast deeplearning training framework base on pytorch 1.3.**


This project work for train, validation, test, with general dataset by different model or use the custom dataset that generate by specified data structure.


The main purpose of this project :

* Start a fast training instance on the standard datasets with default pre-trained model.
*  Automatic build the dataset from original images & labels with **the specified data structure rule**.
* Support for some state-of-the-art models.  
* Use Json config file configure the training / validation /inference instance to avoid change the project code.

****

#### Main Features:

##### 1.DataSet Generator

*  Automatic build the dataset from original images & labels with **the specified data structure rule**.


##### 2.Fast traing from template config file

* Use Json config file configure the training / validation /inference instance to avoid change the project code.



##### 3.Instance like training management 

* Start a fast training instance on the standard or generated datasets with default pre-trained model.


##### 4.Great automatic process & visulization
